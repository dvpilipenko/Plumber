# Plumber Game

1. Password 1 lvl: JustWarmingUp

2. Known limitations of your solution
- maybe on older phones it may work with a delay
- other limitations, are ready to discuss 


3.  Key design decisions made, especially if you considered multiple options
- it was decided to draw only the necessary elements on canvas, since there are levels with a very large number of elements
- for styles, I used module css that was quite enough to solve the tasks, in real projects it would probably be more convenient to use PostCSS or Styled Component and e.t.c
- you can use the drag and drop mechanism to scroll the camera on larger levels
